# Project XDC-Intel: Securing the XDC Network from Within

## 1. Executive Summary

In a decentralized world, **security cannot be outsourced**. Recognizing the urgent need for proactive, independent threat monitoring, we launched **Project XDC-Intel** — the first fully autonomous, public-facing cybersecurity system designed specifically for the XDC Network.

With daily  scans, public GitHub reporting, and dynamic X (Twitter) notifications, XDC-Intel strengthens trust in the network's bridges and critical infrastructure. Built without fanfare. Focused purely on protecting XDC from within.

## 2. Problem Statement

**Bridges are the new battleground.**

In recent years, major blockchain exploits have overwhelmingly targeted cross-chain bridges, causing billions in losses. As XDC Network expands into bridging assets like USDC, the risk profile grows. Yet until now, no independent system was actively scanning for early signs of exploitation or anomalous activity on XDC bridges.

**Silence isn't safety.** Without independent monitoring, risks go undetected until it's too late.

## 3. Project XDC-Intel: The Solution

XDC-Intel fills the critical gap:

- ✅ Twice-daily autonomous blockchain scans
- ✅ Public threat reports posted to GitHub
- ✅ Immediate alerts or "heartbeat" messages posted to X
- ✅ Open-source transparency of threat intelligence logic

Whether threats are found or not, **the community knows**.  
There is no more guessing. No more waiting for disasters.

📡 Scan Schedule and Frequency

The XDC Threat Monitoring System performs continuous monitoring of blockchain activity to detect threats and critical events in near real-time.

Initially, scans were scheduled twice per day (3:00 AM and 3:00 PM UTC). However, in pursuit of faster detection and broader coverage across all time zones, the system has been upgraded.

✅ Current Schedule:
Frequency: Every hour, 24 times per day
Time Standard: UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)
Purpose: Rapid detection of bridge-related anomalies, critical movements, and emerging threats
This hourly cadence ensures:

Faster identification of high-value transactions across the USDC bridge
Immediate alerts for suspicious contract interactions
A stronger and more resilient early warning system for the XDC community
The results of every scan are automatically published to GitHub for transparency, and future system upgrades will include on-chain alerts and AI-powered pattern recognition.

## 4. Architecture Overview

**XDC-Intel Architecture:**

- VPS Linux Server (Contabo)
- Python-based blockchain scanners (bridge scam detection, critical infrastructure monitoring)
- Scheduled cronjobs (every hour)
- GitHub Actions: automatic push of new reports
- Dynamic X posting system via tweepy API

**Public Transparency:**  
All threat reports, code updates, and system status logs are openly published.

## 5. Deployment and Automation

- ✅ VPS-based fully autonomous operations
- ✅ Cronjob-managed scans twice daily
- ✅ Automated README heartbeat updates
- ✅ Safe separation between testing and live posting scripts
- ✅ Robust fallback in case of RPC overloads (planned)

The system **requires no manual intervention** for daily operations, ensuring maximum uptime and reliability.

## 7. Roadmap: What's Coming Next

| Feature | Status |
|:---|:---|
| Multi-RPC support for redundancy | Planned |
| Telegram bot for private early-warning alerts | Planned |
| Discord integration for server-wide monitoring | Planned |
| Real-time public dashboard for XDC network health | Planned |

## 8. Call to Action: Protecting XDC From Within

This is just the beginning. 

**XDC must be defended by those who care about its future.**

XDC-Intel will continue expanding, iterating, and improving — without asking permission, without politics, without excuses.

The mission is simple:

> “Protect the network from within. Give the community real visibility. Never blink.”
